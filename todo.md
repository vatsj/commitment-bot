bot should be able to:
- create and remove commitments tied to a specific user
- register the completion of a commitment
- register incomplete commitments after a time limit and respond

possible other functionality:
- register one-off commitments with a time bound
- idk anything else people can think off (some kind of multi-person setups? competitive commitment devices?)
